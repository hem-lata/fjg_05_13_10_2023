        <p class="center">A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a
            single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized
            into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end,
            and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>
        <p class="center">Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series
            of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or
            process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories;
            or describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share
            certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.

        </p>
        <p class="center">Most paragraphs in an essay have a three-part structureâ€”introduction, body, and conclusion.
            You can see this structure in paragraphs whether they are narrating, describing, comparing, contrasting, or
            analyzing information. Each part of the paragraph plays an important role in communicating your meaning to
            your reader.

            ntroduction: the first section of a paragraph; should include the topic sentence and any other sentences at
            the beginning of the paragraph that give background information or provide a transition.

            Body: follows the introduction; discusses the controlling idea, using facts, arguments, analysis, examples,
            and other information.</p>
